Nilt's Food Bag v1.0

The bag can be crafted on any textile bench.  It should hold any plant or food, stopping the timer for it to spoil, if applicable.  It has 40 inventory slots and does not benefit from talents which add more.  Foods and plants are sometimes added to the bag automatically, though not always.  As a result, it's advisable to keep an eye on anything you care about to be sure it ends up inside.

This mod uses only a single vanilla item, that being the icon for the Farmer's Satchel.  As such, it should be compatible with any future updates barring that icon being renamed in the game's files.  Even then, it should still work, just with a blank icon.
